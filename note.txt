Observation:
with contacts enabled, constraint = -99 on step 0, velocity gets nuked
With contacts disabled for the ball, it moves perfectly at 2 m/s along ball_x


Probelm
[FORCE DEBUG] dof=16 | ... constraint=-99.012505 ...
[CONTACT DEBUG2] ncon = 43
[CONTACT DEBUG2] con#42 ball(97) vs table(38) | dist=-3.633551, normal=[... 0 0 1], proj_on_x=0.000

Reson:
dist=-3.633551 → the ball is 3.6 units inside the table collider (massive penetration)






physics
the ball joint was jamming the ball from rotating, i temporarily made it a 'free ball' for this milstone
the ball was deeply penetrated in （-3.633551）, the contacts solver forces a constraint=-99.012505 to the ball, so the ball is smashed and static
physics is generally good
if i resize the ball, the solver detects a gigantic ball penetrated to the table wihch trggers a huge repelling force +z


the rendering problem:
